This directory provides support for building the lambda notebook as a
standalone app.  Currently, this can only be done completely for OS X.

Here is what it does right now:

1. Bootstrap a self-contained virtualenv containing the lambda notebook and the
necessary infrastructure to run it.  This requires only python3 and
easy-install (you may need to fiddle with names/paths to get this to run).
    * Currently this doesn't install most of the scipy stack.
    * It doesn't install matplotlib
    * It doesn't use the local version of the lambda notebook, but gets the
      current master from git.
    * While it is occasionally (mis-)used this way, virtualenv is not a good
      packaging solution.  In my testing, even with things like --relocatable,
      this virtualenv does not reliably run on computers other than the one it
      was built on, because of low-level library dependencies.

2. Use py2app relative to this virtualenv to build an app bundle that contains
everything needed to run the notebook.  This (because of the way apps work)
cannot be double-clicked.

3. Use platypus to wrap another app bundle around this that starts the
notebook, displays the output in a window, and opens a browser window to the
notebook browser.
    * You will need the command-line tool for platypus installed; you can do
      this in the platypus preferences window.

Step 1 should be applicable to any platform.  Step 2 should be transferrable to
py2exe but I haven't gotten anywhere near this now.  Step 3 is OS X specific.
To work on OS X version n, the app needs to be built on that version or an
earlier one.

Future packaging work may involve:
    * a more sophisticated wrapper, potentially up to a native app using
      webkit.
    * packaging for windows (use py2exe?).  Contributions welcome.
    * better support for customization; right now it is hard to change the
      notebook directory in a good way.
