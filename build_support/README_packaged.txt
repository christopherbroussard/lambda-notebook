# IPython Lambda Notebook.  

Requires OS X 10.9 or later.

For more info see:

To install, drag "Lambda Notebook.app" to your Applications folder.  Double
click, and it will start up the notebook server and load the interface in your
default web browser.

You may need to enable the app in gatekeeper, in your System Preferences
(System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Allow apps downloaded from).

The app will create a notebooks folder in "~/Documents/lambda_notebook/", where
"~" stands in for your home directory, and install some default notebooks there.

Bug reports to kgr@jhu.edu!  This is a very preliminary release.
